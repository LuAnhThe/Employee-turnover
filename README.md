# Employee-turnover
The employee_turnover.csv dataset was created by IBM data scientists. It provides employee data on various attributes related to job characteristics, work environment, employee demographics, â€¦ and whether the employee is active or terminated.  I carried out analysis reports on employee turnover so that actions can be taken to help reduce employee turnover in the future.
## Key analytical questions for HR managers:
- How does the company's turnover rate compare to industry standards?
- To what extent has the company lost its top performers?
- Is employee turnover related to employee satisfaction with the company?
- What are the top reasons for employees' proactive turnover?
- Which job types, departments, and office locations have the highest turnover rates?
- How do employee satisfaction and involvement affect employee turnover?
- Which gender and age demographics are more likely to have employees
actively quit?
- Do job conditions such as overtime, work-life balance, commute distance, current manager, etc. affect employee turnover?
